==========

A module containing a custom action to allow site admins to revert a Node to the previous revision.

COMPATIBILITY NOTES
==================
- This module doesn't attempt to set or keep the original author or previous nodes author value set for the newly created node revision. So, it is assumed that for example user 1 (or a Role with sufficient permissions) is using this module.
